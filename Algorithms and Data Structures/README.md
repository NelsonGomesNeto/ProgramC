# Flow and Matching :heart:
## Max Flow, Maximum Matching :heart:
* #### Dinic's algorithm is enough for every problem I've tested. NEVER change the algorithm, there's always a way to model in a way that it will magically work :smiley:
* #### Problems
  * [Fast Flow](https://www.spoj.com/problems/FASTFLOW/) (Heavy optimization needed)
  * [Matching](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MATCHING/) (Heavy optimization needed)
  * [Attacking Rooks](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=602&page=show_problem&problem=4406) (Modeling is pretty incredible)
  * [Martian Volei](https://thehuxley.com/problem/643) (Modeling is beautiful and a bit simple)
  * [670 - The dog task](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=611) (Modeling isn't hard)
  * [Keep It Covered](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/pt/problems/view/2705) (Modeling is quite hard... Probably because I wanted to retrieve exact pieces and orientation (for visualization purpose: [keepitcovered.pde](https://github.com/NelsonGomesNeto/ProgramC/tree/master/Visualization/KeepItCovered/keepitcovered)), but here are some hints: bipartite, needs "unification vertex", checkerboard, only dots and lines need to be mapped)

## Min Cost Flow :heart:
* #### minCostFlow with successive shortest paths.
  * ##### Shortest path algorithms (ordered by the fastest first):
    Always use *Dijkstra with Potentials*, unless the graph has negative edges at the first step; in these cases, use *SPFA*
    * Dijkstra with Potentials O(|E| + |V|log|V|): The intuition behind is that it calculates to difference in cost instead of the actual cost of each step; therefore, it won't have negative costs. It's identical to an ordinary Dijkstra, except that "cost[v] = cost[u] + graph[u][v]", you will have "cost[v] = cost[u] + graph[u][v] + potentials[u] - potentials[v]" and after running dijkstra, you will need to add the costs to the potentials.
    * SPFA O(|V||E|) but usually O(|E|): Kind of a mix between bellmanFord and dijkstra, but doesn't uses a priority queue, so it works perfectly even with negative costs.
    * bellmanFord O(|V||E|): It's very straight forward, but it's dangerous to use it here, although will work mostly.

* #### The successive shortest paths implementation is easy to implement and understand, so I'm using it. It seems like it's more then enough for everything.
* #### Problems
  * [10594 - Data Flow](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=1535) (It requires bidirectional edges, so be careful)
  * [11301 - Great Wall of China](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&category=808&problem=2276) (Requires better shortest path algorithm then bellmanFord's, SPFA will do; and has cost on vertices)
  * [10806 - Dijsktra, Dijsktra](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=808&page=show_problem&problem=1747) (Edges must me utilized only once, so modeling is a bit mind blowing, but quite easy)
  * [Beating the dices in their own game](https://www.hackerearth.com/pt-br/practice/algorithms/graphs/minimum-cost-maximum-flow/practice-problems/algorithm/beating-the-dices-in-their-own-game/) (Matrix won't do, use list of edges)
  * [Amazing Race](https://www.hackerearth.com/pt-br/practice/algorithms/graphs/minimum-cost-maximum-flow/practice-problems/algorithm/amazing-race-3/)
  * [Ciel and Duel](https://codeforces.com/contest/321/problem/B) (*maxCostFlow* haha, an additional if is needed though)

# Segment Tree :heart:
## Segment Tree without Lazy Propagation :heart:
* #### Problems
  * [Fundraising](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/2700) (It's not trivial, we use a max segtree to apply a greedy strategy)
  * [Keep It Energized](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/2010) (It's not trivial, we use min segtree to apply a greedy strategy)
  * PLEASE ADD MORE PROBLEMS HERE

## Segment Tree with Lazy Propagation :heart:
* #### Problems
