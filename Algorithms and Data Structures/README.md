# Flow and Matching :heart:
## Max Flow, Maximum Matching :heart:
* #### Dinic's algorithm is enough for every problem I've tested. NEVER change the algorithm, there's always a way to model in a way that it will magically work :smiley:
* #### Problems
  * [Fast Flow](https://www.spoj.com/problems/FASTFLOW/) (Heavy optimization needed)
  * [Matching](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MATCHING/) (Heavy optimization needed)
  * [Attacking Rooks](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=602&page=show_problem&problem=4406) (Modeling is pretty incredible)
  * [UVA Problem Package](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=685)

## Min Cost Flow :heart:
* #### minCostFlow can almost always be done with bellmanFord
* #### Problems
  * [10594 - Data Flow](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=1535) (It requires bidirectional edges, so be careful)
  * [Beating the dices in their own game](https://www.hackerearth.com/pt-br/practice/algorithms/graphs/minimum-cost-maximum-flow/practice-problems/algorithm/beating-the-dices-in-their-own-game/) (Matrix won't do, use list of edges)
  * [Amazing Race](https://www.hackerearth.com/pt-br/practice/algorithms/graphs/minimum-cost-maximum-flow/practice-problems/algorithm/amazing-race-3/)
  * [UVA Problem Package](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=808)


# Segment Tree :heart:
## Segment Tree without Lazy Propagation :heart:
* #### Problems
  * MISSING PROBLEMS, FILL IT PLEASE :)

## Segment Tree with Lazy Propagation :heart:
* #### Problems
  * [Light Switching](https://www.spoj.com/problems/LITE/) (Pure Segment Tree)
  * [11402 - Ahoy Pirates](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=2397) (Set update, be careful)
  * [Acordes Intergal√°ticos](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/2658) (Time is very short, be careful with constants)


# LCA
* #### Problems
  * [Lowest Common Ancestor](https://www.spoj.com/problems/LCA/) (Pure LCA, no tricks)
  * [Match Match](http://www.codcad.com/problem/147) (Pure LCA, but queries for distance)
  * [Ants Colony](http://www.codcad.com/problem/160) (Same as above, but edges have distance)
